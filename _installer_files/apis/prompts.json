        "prompt": "A realistic, first-person perspective video shot moving through a narrow residential hallway. The corridor features textured beige wall-to-wall carpeting and off-white walls with white trim. Several closed white doors line the right side of the hall. Soft, warm recessed lighting is embedded in the ceiling. In the background at the end of the hallway, a brightly lit living area is visible, containing a dark brown leather armchair and a large window covered by sheer white curtains. Action: The camera moves steadily forward down the center of the hallway. Upon reaching an open doorway frame on the immediate left, the camera smoothly pivots and turns 90 degrees to the left, transitioning the view from the long corridor into the room on the left side.",

        "prompt": "A realistic, cinematic first-person point-of-view shot moving through a dim, warm-toned home interior. The camera begins in an open living space with dark hardwood flooring, facing a central hallway that leads to a front door. The camera immediately initiates a smooth, walking-pace forward motion and banks to the left, executing the action of entering the kitchen. As the view shifts left, the camera glides past a row of high-back, beige upholstered bar stools positioned at a dark blue kitchen island with white marble countertops. The focus sharpens on the kitchen details: dark shaker-style cabinetry, a stainless steel refrigerator, and a tiled backsplash illuminated by under-cabinet lighting. The central hallway, featuring a white runner rug and a wooden staircase with white spindles, and the dining room on the right with wainscoting and wallpaper, slowly pan out of view as the camera fully commits to the kitchen space.",

To the immediate left stands a wooden chest of drawers with visible horizontal handles. On the right side of the frame is a bed dressed in white linens, a mustard-yellow throw blanket, pink pillows, and a wooden bench with a dark cushion at the foot. In the background, open glass doors framed by grey curtains reveal a bright, sunlit outdoor patio area with white structures. A dark ceiling fan is mounted above. The camera moves forward and steers smoothly to the left, focusing its trajectory directly toward the wooden chest of drawers, simulating a person walking across the room to approach the furniture.",

To the left, a tall dark wooden bookshelf stands against the wall. On the right, a person is seated at the antique wooden desk, actively studying. The person is leaning over an open textbook, reading intently and writing notes with a pen in a notebook. The desk has a stereo and loose papers on it. In the background, beyond the archway, is a wooden dining table with chairs and a kitchen with a stainless steel fridge, illuminated by natural daylight from a window. The lighting is soft and natural. The camera holds steady or pushes in very slowly as the person turns a page of the book, focusing on their work.",
